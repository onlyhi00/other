Mark, I am not coming. Maybe I am wrong. But unfortunately i have scammed on upwork before, and i see a picture of certain guy in a suit from florida and nothing about that call we just had made me feel like thats who i was talking to ha

Mark Andersen 8:14 PM
You removed this message

Philip, I'm going to level with you. I work with a partner, and since I was out with my son he tried to take the call so we didn't lose the job proposal. I am Mark, I do live in Florida, and I work this account with a partner. I am 100% confident we can knock this project out of the park, and there is no scam her. I can call you on my cell phone and talk to you directly. I'm a man struggling to make ends meet with side projects, and I would really like your business. I promise you you'll be extremely happy with the results of our work

We're just getting started and are trying to build up a strong profile here, and we want to do that by going above and beyond for our clients. Between him and I, we cover just about everything from backend databases to websites, to cloud services, and everything in between. I promise you, if you give us a chance, you will 100% not be disappointed.

no thanks. I would have accepted that if it was what you said to start. I dont want to have to use instinct and figure things out on my own. Shoot people straight the first time. wish you the best

Mark Andersen 8:19 PM
I was driving with my son. I came home to this, and my partner kind of panicked. He's a younger guy, but I've been in the business for over 20 years. I understand your reservations, but Philip, trying to get projects on this site without a proven track record of satisfied customers is almost impossible. I know we can knock this out of the park and make you extremely happy with the results, all I'm asking is for the chance.



I apologize my partner didn't handle this in the best way. He and I are still working out the kinks with all this, but that doesn't change the fact we are experts, and we can meet and exceed your expectations.

Are you an EXPERT in python?

Mark Andersen 8:23 PM
Yes, he and I are both on and you'll have our complete attention. He's actually more of the Python expert. I do more of the backend database, .NET, and cloud services side. But we're both on and you have both our undivided attention until you're satisfied
