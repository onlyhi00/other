laravel experience

Hi.
I gonna tell you about my experiences in tekitcon company.
Tekitcon company provides relationship and hiring environment for clients and technicians.
As you know about upwork and other web sites, this is similar to these platforms.
Our goal was atracting more clients and technicians.
We have used laravel framework for backend and angluar framework for frontend.
We have used laravel view blad for landing page because of SEO friendly.
To improve SEO friendly, goog solution is to divide frontend into landing page and main app.

We have advantages than other platforms so we had focused on decreasing the tees than other platforms first.
Next important point is to prevent scams in job sites.
As you know, even though in upwork, there are many fakers as clients ans freelancers.
They are posting fake jobs and sending fake proposals.
To prevent this, we have implemented KYC parts which are very simple and smart in registeration.
And we have developed a powerful bot which detects the violation from clients and freelancers.
So we have developed a powerful bot with python and integrated with laravel.
Laravel provides Eloquents and relationship for database operations.
The bot has a search engine for detecting the violations of keywords, urls, times and payments.
We have also integrated Twilio Send Grid APIs for receiving and sending emails, sms verifications, notifications and subscriptions.
We have alos integrated Laravel websocket for real chat functions between cliens and freelancers.
With over 4k stars in github, Laravel websocket is currently the most popular websocket.

Solution for laravel and rightly so.
It's ideal for developers working with Laravel websocket for the first time or for those who want to be up and running in no time.
Laravel websocket is only available solution that natively runs on PHP frameworks and can therefore sit right next to your laravel applications.

Regarding the payments, deposit and with money, we have integrated stripe with paypal, visa and credit card.
There are too many features such as sort of proposals with special algorithms and managing the profiles and contracts so I will need over 10 hours to explain all things in my projects.
In total, I have implemented 10 features in this project because we used laravel.
