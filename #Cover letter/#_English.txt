             - How to ask politely to raise your salary
============================================
Thank you so much for the opportunities you've provided me during my time as a sales executive for Rocket Revenue Corporation.
Over the past two years, I've grown significantly as an employee, deepened my understanding of the industry, improved my skill set and taken on many new responsibilities.
For these reasons, I want to request an adjustment to my salary.
As you're aware, my salary has remained the same since January 2021.
Since then, I have accomplished the following:
...
I want to request a base salary increase of 5%, which is in line with the average salary for a sales executive with my level of experience in our geographic region.
If possible, I want to meet to discuss my request in person.
I'm happy to work with you to accommodate this request and am open to negotiation.
Please let me know when is best to talk through this further.
==============================================
I believe I have gone above and beyond the benchmarks we set for my position when I arrived at the company three years ago.
I would therefore appreciate the opportunity to meet with you to discuss increasing my salary so that it is commensurate with my current performance.
I request a pay raise of 6%, which I believe reflects both my current competencies and industry averages.
Once again, I am grateful to be a member of this organization, and I enjoy taking on assignments that allow me to contribute to the company.
===============================================
As you know, I started at ABC Corp two years ago as an intern and came on board at a salary that was slightly low in the pay band, with the understanding that we would revisit my pay at review time.
Since then, of course, we’ve all been too busy to think much about anything but hitting our deadlines.
I feel so fortunate to have had the opportunity to start my career with mentors like you and Jack and to continue to learn in a company that's growing so fast.
Over the past two years, I've gladly worn many hats, including lead on our latest project.
In addition, I've always exceeded my own goals without missing a single deadline.
I've also continued developing my skillset by taking classes in UX design.
My research indicates that a raise of 10% would be appropriate.
I'd love the opportunity to meet with you and discuss this in person.

Based on what I understand about this role, I think I should be able to meet or exceed expectations.

- “What can you contribute to this company?”
"In my last role, I successfully transformed our team's operations with the implementation of [technology product]. As a result, our productivity jumped by almost 40%. I am always looking for ways to improve and learn something new. I hope I could bring that energy to your team and find new improvements for us. I'm excited to learn more from you about how I can improve in this role."

- “Why do you want to work at this company?”
"I always knew that I wanted to work in this industry because I truly believe that the impact you make is so important. However, your mission goes beyond that and really speaks to how I view my job. I can also see that your organization is growing rapidly, and I am always looking to step up into new challenges. It seems like your department in particular leads the charge on that growth, and I'm excited to be at the forefront of that change."

- “Why do you want this job?”
"Aside from really identifying with [Company]'s mission, I know that I can add to that impact in this role. As I am leaving my current job, I am looking for a strong team to collaborate with and learn from, as well as opportunities for growth. I'm excited by the idea that I could eventually [XYZ] in this role, and I know that my skills in [ABC] can help us increase our impact as a team."

However, my experience has allowed me to grow in both of these areas, with over 7 years dedicated to understanding the execution of this responsibility. After I understood the machinations of that, my role at [previous company] allowed me to plan each step of the process from A to Z. With that experience, I feel confident that I can not only manage this team effectively, but increase collaboration and retention through my management techniques. I have such a niche background with my experience at [company] doing [skill] that I think it really makes me a unique fit for this role. I certainly hope that I could make a positive impact on your team."

- “What is your work style?
"I find that my organizational tools are the key to my success. I usually manage all of my tasks within a platform where I can track everything, and make sure I don't let anything drop. I've worked on teams where we all use these platforms, which can be a fun way to collaborate! In terms of getting work done, I like to set aside blocks of time for focused work and research, and I love coming together with my team for brainstorming sessions. I always find new, exciting ideas in that type of environment. Lastly, I appreciate when context is given for the projects I'm working on, as I find that it helps me prioritize my tasks."

- “What is your management style?”
"I tend to find that my management style is dictated by the individual. I have to learn how they communicate, how they internalize information, and what specifically motivates them. One employee may learn by diving in and doing something themselves, while another may learn by watching. One thing I am always sure to do is to give full context into the tasks I'm asking them to handle. I find this helps with motivation and to show their overall impact. Lastly, I think trust is critical to a functional manager/employee relationship. Without trusting each other, we're not likely to succeed together."

- “What is your greatest strength?”
“I think one of my best qualities is clear communication. When I interact with clients at [Company], I am often dealing with people in [industry] who don’t necessarily speak the same language that we do. However, I can identify their struggle and articulate it back to them in a way that we both understand. I can also explain solutions in simple ways that make it easy for them to grasp the value of our products. For example, I once worked with a client who struggled with [XYZ]. They were not an expert in that and had trouble properly explaining their problem. However, I was able to pick up on it and show them exactly how we could help. They are still a client today, and throughout the years, I’ve acted as a valuable resource to them, which continues to show my expertise in the field. I think this type of communication skill is exactly what you’re looking for in this role, which is why I’m so excited about this opportunity.”

“When I have a disagreement with someone, my first step is to listen to their argument. I always go in with the idea that I might be missing something that is key to understanding.

At the end of the day, I always remain professional and defer to leadership to make a decision.”

- “What is your dream job?”
“While I’m not sure what my end goal in my career is, I do know that I want to be at the forefront of the design field.

As leaders in design technology, I know that I will gain so much out of this experience, and I’m really motivated to make a meaningful contribution here.”

5/21
- Are you willing to fail?
“While failing can be frustrating, I have always tried to look at it as a route to success. I strongly believe in failing fast and early to gain clarity in moving ahead.

- Why have you been out of work?
“I left my last job because I realized I needed a career shift since my work had become extremely monotonous. I took some time off to understand what I truly wanted to do.

5/30
- Tell me about a time you overcame an obstacle
“I firmly believe that obstacles are gateways to new opportunities. One of the obstacles while running my startup was funding. I overcame this by consistently researching and connecting with investors in my city and industry domain. This was followed by convincing them of my vision and getting them to invest in my startup.”

- What have been your most positive and negative management experiences?
“While I have had to make tough management decisions, I haven’t seen them as negative experiences. I have had the opportunity to build and guide a team of extremely capable engineers and designers. I have learned a lot about technology and design through them as well.”

- Tell me something you would have done differently at work.
“I have committed mistakes in the past, but I have always tried to experiment with my work and learn from the things that go wrong. In my early days, I could have probably learned a lot faster if I had asked for feedback openly instead of trying to figure out everything on my own.”

- How much do you expect to get paid?
“I am looking for something around $50,000 per month, considering my experience and abilities. However, I am more interested in this opportunity and excited about the idea. I am open to negotiations for the same.”

- What is your long-range career objective?
"While visiting your company website I noticed that you have some leadership opportunities available in a variety of locations.
