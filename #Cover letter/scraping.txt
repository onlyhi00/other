Hello, my name is Lai and I'm a Data Scientist with extensive knowledge in creating macros with web scraping Chrome extensions and browser automation techniques.

I understand you're looking for someone to create a macro with a web scraping Chrome extension for browser automation and I believe I am the perfect fit for this project. With my experience in creating macros and web scraping using Chrome extensions, as well as proficiency in browser automation techniques, I am confident that I can deliver a successful result within 1-2 weeks that meets all requirements. Specifically, the macro should be able to perform automated actions on websites such as clicking buttons, filling out forms, and navigating through pages.

I would love to discuss this project further if given the opportunity. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like more information about my skillset and past projects.

Best regards,
Lai
